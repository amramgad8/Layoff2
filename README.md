# Layoff Dashboard - Analysis and Insights

## Overview
This task was part of the (DEPI), where I analyzed layoff data from various industries, companies, and locations to provide valuable insights about the workforce's current state. The process involved gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data using an interactive dashboard.

## Data Collection
The first step in the process was to **collect data** from the available sources and perform an initial analysis to understand the structure and content of the dataset. I reviewed the columns and the data types to ensure that the data was properly formatted and ready for further processing.

## Data Cleaning
Once the data was collected, I moved on to the **Data Cleaning** phase, where I:
- Handled **null values** in some columns.
- Removed duplicate rows.
- Ensured the data types were correct for each column.

The cleaning process is crucial to ensure that the data is consistent and ready for meaningful analysis.

## Questions for Analysis
During the analysis, I posed the following questions to guide the process:
- **What industries are most affected by layoffs?**
- **Where are the companies with the highest layoffs located?**
- **Which companies have been most impacted?**

These questions helped in shaping the analysis and provided direction for the data exploration.

## Focus on 100% Layoffs
In the analysis phase, I decided to focus more on companies that experienced **100% layoffs**. This approach allowed me to gather more specific insights regarding companies that had massive workforce reductions and understand the patterns and factors influencing these layoffs.

## Dashboard Insights
The final result was a **dashboard** that visually presents the findings from the analysis. The dashboard includes:
- **Total Layoffs**: Displays the total number of layoffs across all industries and companies.
- **Top Companies Affected**: Lists the companies that have had the most layoffs.
- **Analysis by Industry**: Shows which industries have been most impacted by layoffs.
- **Layoffs by Location**: Identifies the cities and regions with the highest number of layoffs.
- **Layoffs Over Time**: Presents a timeline of layoffs, showing trends and changes over different periods.



## Final Thoughts
I thoroughly enjoyed working on this dashboard and the entire process from data collection to analysis and visualization. It was a great learning experience, and I gained valuable insights into how layoffs are affecting the workforce. I look forward to continuous improvement and progress in this field. ðŸ’ªðŸš€
